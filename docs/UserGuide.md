<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:** <br>

* Multiplicity refers to the number of instances of each field, that a student can have. (e.g. a student can have either 0 or 1 phone numbers associated to him/her)

* More details regarding the use of prefix can be found in the [Features](#features) section below.
</div>


## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the "Format" section for each command:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  Example: For the command `edit STUDENT_INDEX`, `STUDENT_INDEX` is a parameter that must be supplied by the user.<br>
  Thus, the user should input the command `edit 10`, where "10" is the `STUDENT_INDEX` supplied by the user.

* Parameters in square brackets are optional parameters.<br>
  Example: For the command `edit STUDENT_INDEX [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [m/MODULE_CODE]`, the user must supply the `STUDENT_INDEX` parameter in the input, whereas the `PHONE_NUMBER` and `MODULE_CODE` parameters are optional.<br>
  Thus, the user can input the command `edit 10 p/98765432` (`MODULE_CODE` not specified) or `edit 10 p/98765432 m/CS2103` (`MODULE_CODE` specified).

* Parameters with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  Example: For the command `delete STUDENT_INDEX…​`, the user can input `delete 10` (one `STUDENT_INDEX` parameter) or `delete 10 11 12 13` (multiple `STUDENT_INDEX` parameters).

* Parameters can be inputted in any order.<br>
  Example: For the command `add i/STUDENT_ID n/NAME m/MODULE_CODE`, the user can input `add i/A0123456B n/John Doe m/CS2103` (`NAME` followed by `MODULE_CODE`) or `add i/A0123456B m/CS2103 n/John Doe` (`MODULE_CODE` followed by `NAME`).

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but the user specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  Example: For the command `find n/NAME`, if the user inputs the command `find n/John n/Mary`, only `n/Mary` will be interpreted by TAPA.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  Example: For the command `help`, if the user inputs `help help 123`, the input will be interpreted as `help`.
</div>

### Adding a student: `add`

Adds a student to TAPA.

**Format**: `add i/STUDENT_ID n/STUDENT_NAME m/MODULE_CODE [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [t/TELEGRAM_HANDLE] [e/EMAIL_ADDRESS]​`

* The student’s student ID (matriculation number), name as well as module code are compulsory fields.
* The phone number, telegram handle, and email address fields are optional and can be excluded.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:warning: <b>Warning!</b>

* The student's student ID (matriculation number) has to be unique.
* An error message will be displayed to the user if the specified student ID already exists in TAPA.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
<b>Notes:</b> 

* Other than the student ID, all other fields do not have to be unique. For example, two different students could share the same full name.
* The name of the student to be added will be converted to Title Case.
* The current version of TAPA expects that a TA will only teach each student in, at most, one module. Thus, each student to be added can only have one module code.
* You may refer to the [table](#Information about contacts in TAPA) above for more information about each individual field of a student.
</div>

**Example**:
* `add i/AXXXXXXXR n/john m/CS2103T p/98765432 t/johnnn e/e0123456@u.nus.edu`
    * A student named John is added to TAPA.

<br>

### Deleting a student: `delete`

Deletes a student from TAPA.

**Format**: `delete STUDENT_INDEX...` (or) `delete i/STUDENT_ID`

* An error message will be displayed to the user if:
  * the specified index is 0
  * the specified index is a negative number
  * the specified index is larger than the number of students in TAPA
  * there is no student with the specified matriculation number
* Multiple indices can be inputted in order to delete multiple students. All inputted indices must be valid in order for the command to execute successfully.

**Example**:
* `delete 10`
    * A student named John (whose list index is “10”) is deleted from TAPA.
* `delete 10 20`
    * The students named John and Mary (whose list indices are “10” and “20”) are deleted from TAPA.
* `delete i/A0123456Z`
    * A student named John whose matriculation number is "A0123456Z" is deleted from TAPA.

<br>

### Deleting all students taking a particular module: `deleteModule`

**Format**: `deleteModule m/MODULE_CODE`

* All students who are taking the module with the module code specified after the `deleteModule` command will be removed from TAPA.
* An error message will be displayed to the user if there are no students taking the specified module.

**Example**:
* `deleteModule m/CS2100`
    * All students who are specified as taking CS2100 are deleted from TAPA.

<br>

### Finding a student: `find`

Allows the user to look up the details of a particular student.

**Format**: `find n/STUDENT_NAME` (or) `find i/STUDENT_ID` (or) `find m/MODULE_CODE`

* The student whose name, student id or module code is specified after the `find` command will appear in the resulting list.
* Search fields must be exact matches in order for the `find` command to display the result. For example, given a student John in TAPA, `find n/John` will successfully display this student but not `find n/Joh` or `find n/Jo`.

**Example**:
* `find n/John`
    * Displays the particulars of the students whose names include John.
* `find i/AXXXXXXXR`
    * Displays the particulars of the student with student ID AXXXXXXXR.
* `find m/CS2103T`
    * Displays the particulars of the student with module code CS2103T. Also works for module codes with varying lengths.

<br>

### Checking all the tasks that a student has: `task`

    * Marks the first task in the task list for the student with student ID AXXXXXXXR as done.
<br>

### Marking a done task as undone for a student: `unmark`

Marks a specific done task as undone for a particular student.

**Format**: `unmark i/STUDENT_ID idx/DONE_TASK_INDEX`

* The done task corresponding to the index for the particular student will be marked as undone in the TAPA.
* An error message will be displayed to the user if:
  * the specified index is 0
  * the specified index is a negative number
  * the specified index is larger than the number of tasks for that particular student.
  * the task with that specified index for the particular student is already marked as undone.

**Example**:

**Format**: `edit STUDENT_INDEX [i/STUDENT_ID] [n/STUDENT_NAME] [m/MODULE_CODE] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [t/TELEGRAM_HANDLE] [e/EMAIL_ADDRESS]​`

* The index of the student to be edited is a compulsory field.
* The student’s matriculation number, name, module code, phone number, telegram handle, and email address fields are optional and can be excluded. However, at least one field to be edited must be included to execute the `edit` command.
* An error message will be displayed to the user if:
    * the specified index is 0
    * the specified index is a negative number
    * the specified index is larger than the number of students in TAPA
    * the field to be edited is in an invalid format
  
**Example**:
* `edit 10 m/CS2103T p/98765432 t/johnnn e/e0123456z@u.nus.edu`

* A message will be displayed if TAPA is already empty and there are no students to be removed.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
<b>Notes:</b><br>

* Inputting the `clear` command puts TAPA in the "clear confirmation" mode. In this mode, TAPA will not recognise any command other than `confirm`. Inputting any command other than `confirm` will cause TAPA to exit the "clear confirmation" mode and resume its normal operation.
* As clearing TAPA cannot be undone, you will have to click the commandBox again to input `confirm`. (This is an additional measure to ensure a user does not clear TAPA accidentally.) After inputting `confirm`, you can click the commandBox again, then continue to use TAPA as per normal.
</div>

**Example**:
* `clear`
    * TAPA enters its "clear confirmation" mode, where a user can input `confirm` to clear all students from TAPA.

* `confirm`
  * All students cleared from TAPA.

<br>

### Archiving details in the address book: `archive`

Saves a copy of the details currently saved in TAPA into a separate file.

**Format**: `archive`

    * Assigns assignment 1 to student with id AXXXXXXXR.
* `assign m/CS2103T tn/assignment 1`
    * Assigns assignment 1 to students taking module CS2103T.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:warning: <b>Warning!</b>

* As `MODULE_CODE` is case-sensitive, the user should ensure that the capitalisation of the module should be correct, or else the task would not be assigned properly.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
<b>Note:</b>The name of the assigned task will be converted to Title Case.
</div>

<br>

### Viewing the completion status of a particular task: `progress`

:warning: <b>Warning!</b>

* The effects of the [`clear` command](https://ay2122s2-cs2103t-w09-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#deleting-all-students-clear) and the [`undo` command](https://ay2122s2-cs2103t-w09-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#undoing-the-previous-command-undo) cannot be undone!

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
<b>Notes:</b><br>

* While other apps may only allow the undoing of commands that alter stored details, TAPA's `undo` command can revert the changes of almost every command other than `clear` and `undo` itself. (This would include commands like `list`, `sort`, and `add`.) This feature is intended to aid the user in undoing their intended command, since it can be difficult to remember which commands can be undone, or to keep track of the last command that made changes to stored details.
* Inputting `undo` after the [`archive` command](https://ay2122s2-cs2103t-w09-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#archiving-details-in-the-address-book-archive) will not delete the copy of TAPA that has been saved in a separate file.

</div>

* Reverts the changes of the previously executed command, and removes the command from history.

**Example**:
* `undo`
    * Displays the command that has been undone.
    * The changes made by the previously executed command are undone.
    * The undone command is removed from the history of commands.

**Format**: `manual [COMMAND_NAME]`

* The format of the command corresponding to the command name will be displayed, along with a short description.
* If there are no inputs for the command name, all the available commands will be displayed.
* An error message will be displayed to the user if the user input a command name that is invalid.

**Example**:
* `manual add`
    * Display the format for the command add, and briefly describes the command.
* `manual`
    * Display all available commands.

<br>
